* The site uses django templating. This should make it transportable (other templating engines should be easy to accomodate also)
* Please try an code in a platfrom independant way as possible.


=== fg-master ===
Currently the logo and main stylesheet are served off the fg-maste domain. THis is experimental
with the following objectives
* makes the load faster as a browser can connect to different sources. 
  ( some browsers/servers only allow for example five connections per server, with
    more than one server, page elements can be downloaded in parallel)
* Makes for changing the logo globally, or the style globally very easy
* Downside is that its much more difficult to maintain

=== fg-cache ===
This server has the wrong name and should be fg-libs or fg-stash

Contains all the javascript libraries and any other third party stuff, this stuff
is caches ie sends content-expires headers.


-------------------------------
=== fg-www ===
app.yaml contains the "configuration" of the application

The main.py handles the incoming calls and passes them to the app/Handler.py class

the calls are in the form 
/section/page/
eg
/support/
/support/docs/

and display the secion.page.html document

the html templates are in templates/ directory
All (we'll 99%) of the templates inherit MAIN.html

The {% block content %} and {% block right_box %} are popualtes in each template.

The function calls to external resources is in app/fetch.py

The FG_App class is a "proxy" for fetch.py calls and is passed to the templating engine..

eg
## fetch.py
def fetch_pilots():
  ## code here
  return data

## FG_App class
class FG_Aircraft:
  def fetch_pilots(self):
	return app.fetch.fetch_pilots()

## Handler
templates_vars['app'] = FG_App() # instance passed to template

## Html templates (note no () on function call (wish we could pass varibles, liek Smarty.php)

<ul>
{% for pilot in app.fetch_pilots %}
....
