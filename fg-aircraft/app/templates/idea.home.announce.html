  <h3><A NAME="scenery-1.0.1"></A>October 27, 2008 - World Scenery
    v1.0.1 released.</h3><p>  The World Scenery is made in preparation
    for the FlightGear 1.9.0 release, but from a technical point is
    should also work with the previous v1.0 version of FlightGear
    <P>

    In addition to the bugfix the release contains some very fine bits
    of custom scenery work, namely:
    <UL>
      <LI> 6 Caribbean islands plus Helgoland (John Holden, Christian Schmitt)
      <LI> Revised ParisV2 scenario from
           http://helijah.free.fr/flightgear/scenery/ParisV2/ParisV2.htm
           (cleanup and import by Jon Stockill)
      <LI> Taxiway signs at 6 airfields: KSFO, KBWI, KLVK, KRHV, TFFF, TJSJ
      <LI> Major progress in crowding the Scenery with 3D models - by Alexis
           Bory, Gijs de Rooy, Alex Park, Christian Schmitt, Hugo Devon , Paolo
           Savini ....  just to name a few of the many involved contributors;
    </UL>

    <P>

    Acknowledgements:
    <P>

    The scenery was built on a quad-processor machine in San Diego
    with access provided to us by John Graham of Telascience.
    <P>

    Jon Stockill and Martin Spott maintain the static scenery objects
    database at http://scenemodels.flightgear.org/ and provided the
    adjustments of the elevations in the objects DB.
    <P>

    Curt Olson provided us with valuable hints as a long-time scenery
    builder and TerraGear development.
    <P>

    Special thanks go to John Holden and Christian Schmitt, who by
    their work on manual digitizing of Landsat imagery in the
    Caribbeans and at Helgoland have helped us pushing the envelope of
    custom scenery in the official scenery release. We sincerely hope
    that by this newfound experience more people will go this way of
    improving the data in the landcover database.
    <P>

    Base data:
    <P>

    The scenery was generated with terragear-cs, the Custom Scenery
    version of TerraGear, available at
    http://mapserver.flightgear.org/git.
    <P>

    Except for the obvious cases listed above the following base data was used:
    <UL>
      <LI> landcover and line data: VMAP0, as available on
           http://mapserver.flightgear.org/
      <LI> airport data (apt.dat): as included in FlightGear Release 1.0
      <LI> elevation data: SRTM v2 3arcsec and 30arcsec data
      <LI> static objects: current status of the FlightGear Static
           Scenery Database (http://scenemodels.flightgear.org/) as of
           29th of October 2008
    </UL>

    <P>

    As apt.dat is distributed with the base package instead of the
    scenery itself we were unable to use up-to-date airport data. This
    scenery release is intended to serve as official scenery for the
    current FlightGear release and therefore its contents must be
    synchronized with the contents of the released base package.
    <P>

 <h3><A NAME="scenery-1.0.0"></A>March 4, 2008 - World Scenery v1.0.0 released.</h3><p>
    The World Scenery is made for FlightGear 1.0.0, but from a technical
    point is should also work with the previous v0.9.8 - v0.9.10 versions of
    FlightGear. The scenery is based on the following data sources:
    <UL>
      <LI>landcover/landmass data provided from the
        <A HREF="http://mapserver.flightgear.org/">FlightGear MapServer</A>,
        identical with VMap0 data
      <LI>elevation data: SRTM3 version 2, SRTM30/GTOPO30 version 2 (both
        from ftp://e0srp01u.ecs.nasa.gov/srtm/version2/)
      <LI>airport data: apt.dat as released with the V1.0 base package
      <LI>Most objects and models from the <A HREF="http://scenemodels.flightgear.org/">

        Scenery Objects Database</A>
    </UL>
    The main changes relative to the old world scenery are:
    <UL>
      <LI>points previously classified as "town", but not having much in
        common with settlements at all, have been removed
      <LI>airport layouts updated
      <LI>objects from the Scenery Objects Database updated
    </UL>
    In addition, the order of taxiways from the airport database is now used
    as specified in the apt.dat-file - in contrast to being sorted by size
    as in previous scenery builds. Many taxidraw users have been using the
    sorting of the taxiways to achieve specific visual effects, which are
    visible now in the scenery.
    <P>

 <h3><A NAME="aerospace2"></A>July 11, 2005 - The MathWorks Announces
    Aerospace Blockset 2.</h3><p>

    <EM>New FlightGear Flight Simulator Interface Brings Vehicle
    Modeling, Simulation, and Visualization Capabilities to the
    Desktop.</EM>
    <P>

    NATICK, Mass. - (BUSINESS WIRE) - July 11, 2005
    <A HREF="http://www.mathworks.com">The MathWorks</A>

    today announced the availability of the
    <A HREF="http://www.mathworks.com/products/aeroblks/">Aerospace
    Blockset 2</A>,
    which builds on the foundation of Simulink(R) and Model-Based
    Design for aerospace vehicle modeling, simulation, and
    visualization. New features bring high-quality flight simulation
    graphics to the desktop, where modeling and simulation is more
    accessible and economical than design and test conducted in a
    lab. Additionally, the new version provides off-the-shelf,
    drag-and-drop representations of aerospace components using
    standards-based reference models. Consequently, engineers can use
    the Aerospace Blockset 2 to optimize vehicle subsystem
    configurations and rapidly perform subsequent tradeoff studies
    earlier in the design stage.
    <P>

    Interfacing with FlightGear flight simulator software, new
    animation blocks in the Aerospace Blockset 2 enable users to
    visualize vehicle dynamics in a sophisticated 3-D simulation
    framework. Engineers can now quickly evaluate and verify complex
    flight dynamics before committing to a final design by using
    Simulink for multidomain simulation and Model-Based Design.
    <P>
