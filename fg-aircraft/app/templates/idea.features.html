<h1>FlightGear Features</h1>

<h3>High degree of Freedom</h3>

<p>{{ iconf.tm }} is an open-source project.  This means as long as you abide
by the terms of the GPL license you may freely download and copy
{{ iconf.tm }}.  Anyway can have easy and open access to the latest
development source code.  Being an open-source project, we have made
our file formats open and easily accessible.  We support standard 3d
model formats and much of the simulator configuration is controlled
through xml based ascii files.  Writing 3rd party extensions for
{{ iconf.tm }} (or even directly modifying the FlightGear source code) is
straightforward and doesn't require a large amount of reverse
engineering.  This makes {{ iconf.tm }} an attractive option for use in
private, commercial, research, or hobby projects.<p>

<p>{{ iconf.tm }} is known to run on Windows, Linux, Mac OS-X, FreeBSD,
Solaris, and IRIX platforms allowing the user run on their platform of
preference.</p>

<h3>Flight Dynamics Models</h3>

With {{ iconf.tm }} it is possible to choose between three primary Flight
Dynamics Models.  It is possible to add new dynamics models or even
interface to external "proprietary" flight dynamics models:<BR>
 
 <OL>
  <LI> <A HREF="http://www.jsbsim.org"><STRONG>JSBSim</STRONG></A>:
       JSBSim is a generic, 6DoF flight dynamics model for simulating
       the motion of flight vehicles.  It is written in C++.  JSBSim
       can be run in a standalone mode for batch runs, or it can be
       the driver for a larger simulation program that includes a
       visuals subsystem (such as FlightGear.)  In both cases,
       aircraft are modeled in an XML configuration file, where the
       mass properties, aerodynamic and flight control properties are
       all defined.</LI><BR>

  <LI> <STRONG>YASim</STRONG>: This FDM is an integrated part of
       FlightGear and uses a different approach than JSBSim by
       simulating the effect of the airflow on the different parts of
       an aircraft.  The advantage of this approach is that it is
       possible to perform the simulation based on geometry and mass
       information combined with more commonly available performance
       numbers for an aircraft.  This allows for quickly constructing
       a plausibly behaving aircraft that matches published
       performance numbers without requiring all the traditional
       aerodynamic test data.</LI><BR>

  <LI> <A HREF="http://www.ae.uiuc.edu/m-selig/">
       <STRONG>UIUC</STRONG></A>: This FDM is based on <A
       HREF="http://techreports.larc.nasa.gov/ltrs/PDF/NASA-95-tm110164.pdf">
       LaRCsim</A> originally written by the NASA. UIUC extends the
       code by allowing aircraft configuration files instead and by
       adding code for simulation of aircraft under icing
       conditions.<P>

       UIUC (like JSBSim) uses lookup tables to retrieve the component
       aerodynamic force and moment coefficients for an
       aircraft... and then uses these coefficients to calculate the
       sum of the forces and moments acting on the aircraft.</LI><BR>

<h3>Extensive and Accurate World Scenery Data Base</h3>

<UL>
  <LI> Over 20,000 real world airports included in the full scenery set.

  <LI> Correct runway markings and placement, correct runway and
       approach lighting.

  <LI> Taxiways available for many larger airports (even including the
       green center line lights when appropriate.)

  <LI> Sloping runways (runways change elevation like they usually do
       in real life.)

  <LI> Directional airport lighting that smoothly changes intensity as
       your relative view direction changes.

  <LI> World scenery fits on 3 DVD's.  (I'm not sure that's a feature
       or a problem!)  But it means we have pretty detailed coverage
       of the entire world.

  <LI> Accurate terrain worldwide, based on the most recently released
       SRTM terrain data.)  3 arc second resolution (about 90m post
       spacing) for North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and
       Australia.

  <LI> Scenery includes all vmap0 lakes, rivers, roads, railroads,
       cities, towns, land cover, etc.

  <LI> Nice scenery night lighting with ground lighting concentrated
       in urban areas (based on real maps) and headlights visible on
       major highways.  This allows for realistic night VFR flying
       with the ability to spot towns and cities and follow roads.

  <LI> Scenery tiles are paged (loaded/unloaded) in a separate thread
       to minimize the frame rate hit when you need to load new areas.

<h3>Accurate and Detailed Sky Model</h3>

FlightGear implements extremely accurate time of day modeling with
correctly placed sun, moon, stars, and planets for the specified time
and date.  FlightGear can track the current computer clock time in
order to correctly place the sun, moon, stars, etc. in their current
and proper place relative to the earth.  If it's dawn in Sydney right
now, it's dawn in the sim right now when you locate yourself in
virtual Sydney.  The sun, moon, stars, and planets all follow their
correct courses through the sky.  This modeling also correctly takes
into account seasonal effects so you have 24 hour days north of the
arctic circle in the summer, etc.  We also illuminate the correctly
placed moon with the correctly placed sun to get the correct phase of
the moon for the current time/date, just like in real life.


<h3>Flexible and Open Aircraft Modeling System</h3>

FlightGear has the ability to model a wide variety of aircraft.
Currently you can fly the 1903 Wright Flyer, strange flapping wing
"ornithopters", a 747 and A320, various military jets, and several
light singles.  FlightGear has the ability to model those aircraft and
just about everything in between.<P>

FlightGear has extremely smooth and fluid instrument animation that
updates at the same rate as your out-the-window view updates (i.e. as
fast as your computer can crank, and not artificially limited and
chunky like in some sims.)<P>

FlightGear has the infrastructure to allow aircraft designers to build
fully animated, fully operational, fully interactive 3d cockpits
(which even update and display correctly from external chase plane
views.)<P>

FlightGear realistically models real world instrument behavior.
Instruments that lag in real life, lag correctly in FlightGear, gyro
drift is modeled correctly, the magnetic compass is subject to
aircraft body forces -- all those things that make real world flying a
challenge.<P>

FlightGear also accurately models many instrument and system failures.
If the vacuum system fails, the HSI gyros spin down slowly with a
corresponding degradation in response as well as a slowly increasing
bias/error.

<h3>Moderate Hardware Requirements</h3>

The intention of FlightGear is to look nice, but not at the expense of
other aspects of a realistic simulator.  Our focus is not on competing
in the "game" market and not on the ultra-flashy graphic tricks.<P>

The result is a simulator with moderate hardware requirements to run
at smooth frame rates.  You can be reasonably happy on a $500-1000
(USD) machine (possibly even less if you are careful) and don't
necessarily need $3000 (USD) worth of new hardware like you do with
the many of the newest games.<P>

That said, the more hardware you throw at FlightGear, the better it
looks and runs, so don't feel like you have to chuck your expensive
new hardware if you just purchased it. :-)

<h3>Internal Properties EXPOSED!</h3>

FlightGear allows users and aircraft designers access to a very large
number of internal state variables via numerous internal and external
access mechanisms.  These state variables are organized into a
convenient hierarchal "property" tree.<P>

Using the properties tree it is possible to monitor just about any
internal state variable in FlightGear.  It's possible to remotely
control FlightGear from an external script.  You can create model
animations, sound effects, instrument animations and network protocols
for about any situation imaginable just by editing a small number of
human readable configuration files.  This is a powerful system that
makes FlightGear immensely flexible, configurable, and adaptable.

<h3>Networking options</h3>

A number of networking options allow FlightGear to communicate with
other instances of FlightGear, GPS receivers, external flight dynamics
modules, external autopilot or control modules, as well as other
software such as <A HREF="http://www.opengc.org/">the Open Glass
Cockpit project</A> and the <A
HREF="http://atlas.sourceforge.net/">Atlas</A> mapping utility.<P>

A generic input/output option allows for a user defined output
protocol to a file, serial port or network client.<P>

A multi player protocol is available for using FlightGear on a local
network in a multi aircraft environment, for example to practice
formation flight or for tower simulation purposes.<P>

The powerful network options make it possible to synchronize several
instances of FlightGear allowing for a multi-display, or even a cave
environment.  If all instances are running at the same frame rate
consistently, it is possible to get extremely good and tight
synchronization between displays.
